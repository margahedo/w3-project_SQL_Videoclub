# The Blockbuster - SQL Project

![portada](https://www.wedfest.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/retro-video-tapes-VHS-TABLE-PLAN.jpg)


**Video stores** are one of the symbols of the end of the 20th century and even the beginning of the 21st century.

As a **tribute** to these places that already belong to the past, we are going to build a new database from csv files.

For this project, we will start with 6 `csv` files. 

I will download it, import it, clean it, prepare them to load them in a `sql` database and finally analyze them.

In the analysis there will also be some graphs to better understand the data.

## Get ready!

Loading the data `(.csv)` into dataframes from `Pandas Library` and print the .head() of each df. 

When importing pandas set the option **show all** columns with this code:

 **pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)**


## Clean it all up!

Using the tools: Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling.

Consulting always documentation and resources provided to better understand the tools we are using and how to accomplish what we want.
