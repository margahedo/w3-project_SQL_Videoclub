# The Blockbuster - SQL Project

![portada](https://www.wedfest.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/retro-video-tapes-VHS-TABLE-PLAN.jpg)


Video stores are one of the symbols of the end of the 20th century and even the beginning of the 21st century.

As a tribute to these places that already belong to the past, we are going to build a new database from csv files.

For this project, we will start with 6 `csv` files. 

I will download it, import it, clean it, prepare them to load them in a `sql` database and finally analyze them.

In the analysis there will also be some graphs to better understand the data.

## TO DO's

1. Explore the data and write down what you have found
   - you can use: `df.describe()`, `df["column"]`, etc.
1. Clean the data (you can get rid of columns that doesn't give information)
1. Build your databse
1. Write at least 10 queries including: join, groupby, orderby, where, subqueries….that you think will be useful to get interesting insights from the data.**(SELECT* FROM TABLE_NAME doesn't count...)** 
+ Bonus: Get creative!!! Create totally new tables or enrich the csv files with new data (found on the internet or even made up) that makes your database more valuable.


## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Examine the data and try to understand what the fields mean before building the database.
- Break the project down into different steps - use the topics covered in the lessons to form a check list, add anything else you can think of that may be wrong with your data set, and then work through the check list.
- Use the tools in your tool kit - your knowledge of Python, data structures, Pandas, and data wrangling.
  Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
- Commit early, commit often, don’t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
- Consult documentation and resources provided to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.

## How to deliver the project

1. Create a new repo with the name `sql-data-base-building` on your github account.
   - Create a `README.md` file on repo root with project documentation. Make sure to include as much useful information as possible. Someone that finds the README.md should be able to fully get a gist of the project without browsing your files.
   - Include a `.gitignore`
   - At least 1 jupyter notebook is required
   - Include the necessary code files to create and feed the database.
   - Including your functions in a `src.py` is mandatory.
   
2. Open an `Issue` on this repo and paste your own repo's link.
